There are two .PSD files in this folder, one for the sandard units (ORC_StandardUnits__COLOR) and another for the catapult (Orc_Catapult__COLOR). 
They are set to create any color coded units texture, just change the color of the color layers, and the correction layers will do the rest.

Within the correction layers folder, there are two layers (color and extra color). 
By default, the Color layer is turned on. Turning off this layer, and turning on the extra color, you will get a more color signatured texture.
